[I am Obinna {speaks} Ekwuno](https://twitter.com/Obinnaspeaks) a human first before anything, sometimes a bat 🦇 (I stay up really late). I love building tools for [developers](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby), [writing](https://blog.logrocket.com/author/obinnaekwuno/), [speaking & teaching](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=obinna+ekwuno) and slapping my keyboard till something works. :collision:

I love to learn and share as I go, I am a Media Developer Expert with Cloudinary, this means i know a bit about media on the web, also an Accessibility advocate. 

💬 Ask me about: React, Gatsby, Jamstack, developer experiences, Content Creation.
😏 Fun fact: I am mostly in a journey of finding balance between work and life. 🧘🏽‍♂️, I am a poet on my good days.

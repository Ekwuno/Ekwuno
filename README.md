You'd have to play around and find out at some point, so that's what I do here â€” primarily working with Javascript on the web and contributing to Open source projects. In the last couple of years, I have contributed to projects like [GatsbyJS](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AEkwuno+is%3Aclosed), [Cloudflare Docs](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AEkwuno+is%3Aclosed), and a few PRs in Astro, Vite. 

I'm a front-end engineer and a technical writer. I also advocate for developer communities as a Developer Advocate.  ðŸ”Š

I have some demo projects (Poke around my repos ðŸ‘€), and I love to teach. I also do my absolute best and am very happy to collaborate.
